# CSE120 Digital Design Fundamentals - Digital Logic Simulator Projects

Welcome to my repository for CSE120 - Digital Design Fundamentals, a course that delves into the complexities of digital logic and design using simulators. This repository houses all my projects, labs, and assignments from the course, taught at [Your University's Name]. Each piece of work demonstrates practical applications of digital logic principles and design methodologies using various digital logic simulators.

## Course Overview

CSE120 introduces the fundamentals of digital systems and design. By the end of this course, students are expected to achieve the following learning outcomes:

1. **Logic Operations:** Understand and describe the function of electric circuits performing logic operations, using both logic gate symbols and truth tables.
2. **Boolean Algebra:** Apply Boolean Algebra to describe, analyze, and simplify digital logic circuits.
3. **Number Systems:** Perform operations in various number systems, expanding beyond traditional decimal systems.
4. **Combinational Circuits:** Design, build, debug, and demonstrate complex combinational digital logic circuits.
5. **Synchronous Machines:** Create and troubleshoot complex synchronous digital systems from comprehensive problem statements.
6. **Optimal Design:** Evaluate and choose the best design based on set criteria.
7. **Microprocessor Operations:** Describe the workings of a basic microprocessor, develop an instruction set, and implement this in a simulation environment, including programming and execution.
